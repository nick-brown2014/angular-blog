Story.create(title: "There arent any Sunsets in Ohio", path: "sunsets.docx", body: "They cook dinner a little earlier nowadays, towards the end of the afternoon.  It used to be that Max and Ellie would sit on the patio sipping wine, watching their daughter Cindy play with the girl next door.  They would wait there until the colors of the sun began to deepen and bleed across the sky.  Once the warm air of the afternoon had thickened into evening, and drowsy fireflies had begun to flicker by the woodshed, then it would be time to eat.  Mike would fire up the grill, Ellie would set the table and call Cindy in from play.  The smell of cooked meat would mix and mingle with the scent of freshly cut Ohio grass, and Cindy would want to play for five more minutes, and Ellie would carry her make her wash her hands.  They ate outside, and then Cindy would run off to play again.  Max and Ellie would each have a little more wine and watch as the sun dipped behind the steeple of the old protestant church, and then the horizon.

  Now Max makes the table while the meat is on the grill, and it comes off a little bit too black in the middle.  He doesn’t need to call Cindy back inside, she’s upstairs in her room.  The girl next door asks Cindy why she doesn’t come out and play anymore, and Cindy says that she doesn’t have the time, that she has to finish her homework before dinner.  Cindy’s grades have been going down in school.  Her teachers tell Max that they understand, really, that eventually she’ll go back to the way she was before.  They tell him to be patient.  Max smiles with the corners of his mouth and says thank you.  I’ll try.

  While the meat – chicken, tonight –cools on the plates next to a few pieces of uncooked broccoli and some rice, Max walks over to the stairs.  He looks up at Cindy’s closed door.  Cindy!  Time for dinner!  Then he turns around and walks back to the table, sits down and opens a beer.  A few minutes late Cindy slips down the stairs and into her seat.  They eat quickly, quietly.  Neither of them say anything about the singed chicken.  Max takes frequent glances at the sun, checking his watch in between.  School was good today.  Did you finish your homework?  Yes.  Good.  That’s good.  Max peeks up at the sun again.  It looks a little lower than it should.  Hurry up Cindy, we don’t want to miss it.  Okay dad.

  They don’t say much else as they finish dinner.  Cindy keeps her eyes down on her food.  Her braid dips down, hovers a few inches above her plate.  She eats precisely, carefully, wasting no time between bites.  Max is sloppier, the scrape of his knife across his plate mingles audibly with the crickets in the yard.  He finishes first, and begins to clear the table.  Cindy is done quickly after, Max grabs her plate and carries it to the sink.  He leaves the dishes in a crooked pile to be done later.  In the hallway, Max helps Cindy put on her coat and boots.  It isn’t cold yet, but it will be before they get back.  Out at the truck, Max moves to give Cindy a hand up into the front seat but she hops up on her own, wordlessly.  A few minutes later they’re on I-71 headed south.

  When the sunsets first disappeared, almost a year before, the highways were packed every day in both directions around now.  Lots of people went south, like Max and Cindy did, but even more went north.  They were two different camps, passing each other at sixty miles per hour.  The south-bound drivers were called quitters, but they thought of themselves as realists.  Pessimism and pragmatism often swim in the same conversations.  Those headed north were the optimists, the hopeful searchers.  They bustled off into the woods, into the cornfields, into a new direction every day.  The sunsets are still out there somewhere, they thought.  I’ll find one.  If I just keep looking, I’ll find one.

  Hope is a powerful motivator, but it is also fickle.  The problem with hope is that it feeds off of negativity.  It is resilient in its defiance, strong in the face of an adversary.  When hope surrounds itself with more hope it becomes impatient.  Who is there to prove wrong?  Nobody.  Who is there to point a finger at, aside from ourselves.  Hope is strongest when it is shouted into the cacophony, swallowed by the shouts of the others.  When hope is met with silence instead of fire, it echoes.  Our own words come back to us, but we don’t recognize them.  We say, who made that sound, that angry, hateful sound?  Was it me?

  Eventually the tide of the highway began to turn.  More cars left the hills and the valleys and started going south to Kentucky.  There is something that is much easier in this action, the acceptance.  There is no expectation in south, except that which is certain to be fulfilled.  They grumbled as they turned their cars south and crossed the bridge.  It isn’t our sunset, they said.  Max never understood this idea.  He wanted to say to them, who told you it was your sunset?  If it was your sunset, then it would still be here.  This is exactly the problem.  This is why they left us.  Because we had the audacity to think that they couldn’t.

  So they muttered angrily, about fairness, and faith, and other ideas that people made up so that the world would look the way that they wanted it to.  They muttered, and they drove south.  Back then more people were coming into Ohio than leaving it.  People refused to believe the news, wanted to see it for themselves.  They came from all over the world to see the state without a sunset.  Every last one of them left soon after, confused and unsatisfied.  They would get back on their planes and fly away, muttering to each other, It’s unsettling, isn’t it.  It’s just queer.  None of them could place their finger on it, name the hand that poked them, hard, in the soft space at the bottom of their skulls.  They couldn’t stand another day that didn’t end with a laconic, luxurious stretch into night.

  Curiosity faded quickly for those interested souls.  Then, the most normal, most probable thing of all happened.  Everyone just got used to it.  It took some time, sure, after all people decide to give up at their own rates.  Eventually though, after some months had passed, acceptance became the easiest choice.  Soon, most people didn’t bother to go outside at all.  No more was required than a cursory glance out the window, a pessimistic gaze into the sky, and then a shake of the head.  Another day, they would say, another night.

  It became a stale topic at the water cooler.  Nothing new was to be said about it.  The sunsets were gone, and if they were coming back, well, it wasn’t on account of us.

  There aren’t many people on the roads now.  Max lets the car sit in the middle lane of the highway, fast enough to pass the speed-limit drivers, but not fast enough to make Cindy feel unsafe.  Cindy isn’t watching the road anyways.  Her eyes are fixed out the window up at the sun.  She figures if she keeps it in her sight the whole time then it can’t disappear.  Eventually this tactic always fails.  The sun is too bright for her to keep looking at, even in the corner of her eye.  At some point her eyes begin to water, and she’ll blink and rub them and when she looks again it will be gone.

  The radio plays a country song that Max knows and he hums a little without meaning to.  Music has always had a way of sneaking up on him like that.  Even when he doesn’t want to enjoy it, when he wants to feel sad or brooding, he finds himself humming along or tapping his fingers.  It bothers Max that he can’t control this impulse.  It makes him feel that his emotions are cheap, easily persuaded.  It’s a little battle that he is constantly losing.

  The skyline of Cincinnati proper eventually pops up over the horizon.  The buildings still glint and gleam in the light of the afternoon sun, but that won’t last much longer.  Max knows he has only a few minutes before the sunset starts.  He shifts into the left lane, pushes the accelerator down and tightens his grip on the steering wheel.  After a few weaving turns they’re headed onto the bridge over the Ohio river and into Kentucky.

  That’s where it happens, at the foot of the bridge.  Max doesn’t notice on his own, his eyes are fixed on the road.  He only knows that the sun had gone because suddenly Cindy is gripping his arm with a trembling, ferocious strength.  She doesn’t make any noises, or cry the way that she used to.  The silence is almost worse for Max.  It implies a more mysterious pain.  He feels helpless in front of it.  He drives faster.

  After ten tense, long second the little hand on his arm relaxes.  Max hears Cindy begin to breathe again, shuddering slightly.  He wipes a little sweat from his brow, looks over at her and smiles.  She’s still looking out the window, but peacefully now.  This is Max’s favorite part of the day.  For a just a little while, when she doesn’t think he’s watching her, Cindy looks the way she did before.  Happier.  Max waits to take a look at the sunset himself, keeps his eyes on the road instead.  It’s better if you wait for it, let it hit you all at once.

  They stop just past the river at one of the old lookouts.  The old man selling tickets to the lot is listening to the Reds play on the radio.  He barely looks at Max during the exchange, just glances quickly at his money and then buzzes them through.  There’s only a smattering of other cars in the lot today.  Most of the families and older folks don’t bother to make the drive down any more.  These days the lot is mainly populated by teenagers looking for a convenient excuse to make out with each other.  Many of the other cars in the lot are empty, people park here for the low price and then walk down to the levee.  Max finds some space near the guardrail.

  Now, finally, Max allows himself to raise his eyes up to the sky.  Cindy reclines her seat a little.  They don’t say anything, just watch the colors drift across the horizon.

  Eventually Max reaches back for Cindy’s backpack.

  Do you want to draw this one?

  Cindy nods.  She flips through hundreds of sunsets until she gets to a clean white page.  Max closes his eyes and listens to the sound of Cindy’s pencil moving across the page.  When he’s here in front of the sunset all of his urgency vanishes.  He isn’t worried about when the sunset will fade.  The time stretches out for as long as he wants now.

  When do you think they’ll come back, dad?

  Max opens his eyes and turns towards Cindy.  She’s looking back up at him now, her mouth a taut, thin line.  The pencil quivers slightly as it hovers above the unfinished page.

  He answers slowly, I don’t know, Cindy.  There are a lot of really smart people working on it though, they’ll figure it out.

  It isn’t the answer she wants.  She already knows this, they’ve talked about them before, the teams scouring the corners of the state, the scientists locked in clean white rooms discussing the impossible phenomenon.  Cindy’s young enough to believe that her dad can still perform miracles.  She still hopes that he might reach into his pocket, pull out a sunset and say, I have one right here, Cindy.  All you had to do was ask.

  They are coming back though, right?

  She almost keeps her voice from shaking.  Only on the last word does the faintest tremble break through.  Max rubs his eyes with hands that fell suddenly too heavy for his arms.  The word yes sticks in his throat.  Instead he just gathers her into his arms and holds her there, saying nothing.  Her little hands clutch him back and Max wonders who is holding on tighter.

  The sunset is almost over by the time they let go.  Cindy wipes her eyes and finishes her drawing, ignoring the little wet spots on the paper.  The light is just barely clinging to the tops of the trees by the time that Cindy’s drawing is finished.  She hesitates as she puts the sketchbook and colored pencils back into the bag.

  Dad, I want to show you something, but you have to promise not to be mad.

  The bag sits open in front of her seat.  Cindy chews gently on the tip of her thumb, then reaches in and pulls out a small mason jar.  Littered around the bottom rim of the jar are almost thirty lifeless fireflies.  She holds it to her chest with both hands, and the words tumble out of her one over another.

  I was going to show you! Really, I was, I just… I didn’t know that they would die.  I was going to show you when the jar was full, and I didn’t think about what lightning bugs eat, and then this morning they weren’t moving anymore.  I don’t know what to do…

  Oh, sweetheart, Max says reaching out his hands, here, let me see them.

  Cindy shoves the jar into his hands, happy to pass the problem on.  Max opens it and looks inside.  None of the lightning bugs move, they clearly suffocated a while ago.

  Cindy, Max says, screwing the lid back in place, what were you planning on doing with these?

  Cindy swallows and tugs on the end of her braid, pulls the hairs at the tip apart and pushes them back together again.

  I just thought that if I had enough of them, then I could put them all together and they would be bright enough, and–

  Cindy can’t finish what she’s trying to say, she chokes on the last few words.  Max strokes the top of her head and makes shh noises, and says It’s alright, I understand.  Don’t worry about a thing, I’ll take care of it.

  They wait until dark to cross back over the river into Ohio.  Max puts the jar into the cup-holder on his side of the door, and takes it inside with him when they get home.  He tucks Cindy into bed, kisses her on the brow and walks back out to the patio.  The paint on the woodshed is peeling.  He makes a mental note to touch it up, then pulls out the jar.  The lightning bugs rattle around the bottom, still.  Max unscrews the lid and walks out into the small garden in the corner of the yard.  Ellie had liked to grow her own tomatoes here, and Max had tried to keep the plants alive but he didn’t have the touch for it.  Now the stalks were withered and bare, wilting from the top down back into the ground they came out of.  Max scoops aside some dirt and makes a shallow hole in the ground then shakes the lightning bugs into it.  He slides the dirt back on top of them, pats it down and walks away.

  Inside, Max thinks about having a glass of whiskey before bed.  It helps, usually.  He rests his fingers on the knob, imagines the sound of the ice cracking as the liquor pours over it.  Not tonight.  His fingers slip from the knob, he turns and walks up the stairs past Cindy’s room to his bed.  He’s still carrying the jar with him.  He takes it over to his desk, opens up the bottom drawer with the key that he keeps on a chain around his neck.  He scoots aside some old photographs, a diamond ring and a paper plane and slides the jar in next to them.

  After he locks the drawer and puts the key back around his neck, he stares out of his window for a while.  The moon stares back at him balefully.  Max closes his eyes and breathes deeply for a while, letting in all of the stillness.  After some time passes he gets undressed, and gets under the covers.  He goes to sleep slowly, thinking about how tomorrow will be so much like today.")

Story.create(title: "Sunday Picnic", path: "picnic.docx", body: "The ant made determined progress across the rumpled red tundra of the picnic blanket.  It caught Charlie’s attention as it marched through the hills and valleys of the rough woolen material.  He watched as it passed the pitcher of cranberry juice and approached a plate of tepid mustard-peas.

  His mother was talking to his father between bites of pastrami on rye.

  This is a good thing, you know, to come out and have a picnic on a Sunday.  It’s a good thing to be out in the sun on a day like today, she said.

  Charlie sat with his legs folded to the side, resting on his arm.  His mother had dressed him in high socks and a stiff collared shirt, both of which were uncomfortably itchy and warm in the summer sun. A gentle wind whistled around him.  It provided a measure of relief against the starchy enemy of his shirt, and blew some pollen into his left nostril which began to itch horribly.  Charlie wiped his nose with the back of his hand.

  Charlie stop that, his mother said, If you need to blow, just blow.  I have tissues right here.

  She held out a wad of soft, crumpled white paper at Charlie.  Charlie continued to watch the ant, who was dealing with a particularly steep rise in the blanket’s elevation.  He accepted the tissues, but did not blow his nose.  The itch was gone, and so blowing his nose was not a priority for Charlie.  He let his hand fall back to the blanket, supporting him, tissues gently pulping under his body weight.

  Charlie’s mother turned back towards his father.  She looked at him expectantly, waiting for him to say something.  He was leaning against the tree, watching two young men wrestle down near the water’s edge on the grainy Connecticut sand. He smiled as one of the boys flipped the other, smacking his bare back into the beach.  The bested of the two gave a few more seconds of struggle, but for appearances only.  He was smaller than his opponent and had no chance now of changing the outcome.

  Charlie’s mother sighed and ran her fingers through her hair.  Sweetheart, she said, don’t you think this is nice?  Going out together for a picnic?

  Charlie’s father turned slowly back to look upon his wife, and took a long sip of his lemonade, sucking it through his teeth.

  Finally, he said, Yes, dear.

  Charlie’s mother smiled at this, and turned her attention back to the pastrami sandwich.  Charlie heard none of this exchange.  His entire body was focused on holding perfectly still.  The ant had now rounded the plate of mustard peas and was making a direct course for the open jar of jam.  It sat less than two feet away from the ant, dripping with syrupy sweetness.  Between the ant and the jar lay a patch of unusually mounded blanket.  The ant stopped, sizing up his path through the bunched and redoubled terrain.  Charlie’s right leg was trapped under him and beginning to go numb, but he didn’t dare move for fear of upsetting the balance of the blanket.

  His mother was in the middle of a bite of pastrami on rye when she thought of something she wanted to say.  She spoke around her sandwich between smacking, digestive movements, It’s been a while since we did something like this.  Together, I mean, as a family.  We never go out together.

  Charlie’s father was thinking of other things.  A small part of his brain automatically devoted itself to the task, rummaged through a stock of previously prepared replies, selected one that seemed appropriate.  Work, he said, you know.

  Oh I understand, said Charlie’s mother, I don’t mean to complain.  I just wanted to say that it’s nice, that’s all.  That we’re all here.

  She turned her attention to Charlie, who remained statuesque.  The ant had chosen a path, and was beginning the arduous final leg of its journey.  The numbness in his right leg was steadily mounting but Charlie didn’t dare move, not now at this precious, delicate moment.  He didn’t notice that he was holding his breath.  The itch returned to his nostril, too persistent to be ignored.  Gingerly, with the utmost care Charlie lifted his hand from the blanket and, still holding the tissues, wiped his nose with the butt of his palm.

  Charlie! his mother cried, I gave you the tissues for a reason!  Jesus Charlie, you know I can’t stand it when you don’t listen to me.  She flung her hands up in the air, appealed to her husband.  We’ve talked about this!  The boy never pays attention.

  Charlie was petrified.  His mother’s rapid movements were disturbing the blanket.  The ant was momentarily perched upon a pointed mountaintop as it wiggled back and forth.  It held perfectly still for this exchange, clinging to the fabric.

  Listen to your mother, Charlie, said his father.  He had been jarred out of auto-responses now, removed from his reverie.  Being back in the moment reminded Charlie’s father of the many unwelcome compromises that he was making this Sunday.  He wanted to be watching golf, not sitting at a picnic.  He wanted to silently bear this familial obligation, not participate in it.  Charlie’s father felt the familiar undercurrent of resentment towards his family bubbling to the surface, black and ugly in the shade of the tree.

   He narrowed his eyes at Charlie, who remained silent, Charlie?  Did you hear me?  Did you hear what I said?

  Yes, dad, said Charlie quietly, his eyes still locked on the ant.

  Well then do you have something to say to your mother?

  Sorry mom, Charlie whispered.

  I don’t want you to be sorry, I want you to blow your nose, said his mother, taking another bite.

  I don’t need to blow, said Charlie.

  Obviously you do, or you wouldn’t keep wiping your nose.  I had better not catch you doing it again.  His mother finished this warning between bites of pastrami. The blanket had settled, and to Charlie’s relief the ant began it’s journey once more, undeterred by the recent disturbance.

  His father was engaged in the discussion now, enjoying his part in it.  Picnics suited him poorly.  Places with doors that shut, rooms that led to narrow hallways, these were the spaces that suited Charlie’s father.  He liked lights that could be turned off.  Now he was finally appropriate for this scene.  He could cast a stern authority over his son, become useful again.

  Charlie, you haven’t touched your sandwich yet, said his father.

  He pointed a thick finger at the plate in front of Charlie which held his untouched peanut-butter and strawberry jam sandwich.  Charlie loved peanut-butter and strawberry jam sandwiches.  Almost every day he would beg for one, tugging on his nanny’s dress.  Charlie looked down at the sandwich now.  He imagined his father’s massive hands in that sandwich, crushing the peanut butter between knuckles, smashing the berries in his fist.  There was nothing in the world that Charlie wanted to do less right now than eat that sandwich.

  Charlie, said his father, Your mother made that sandwich for you.  You’re not going to get anything else to eat until dinner.  Now quit being a baby and eat it.

  Charlie nodded.  The ant, meanwhile had passed the halfway point, was on the home stretch.  It stared up at a daunting mound of fabric, then decided to negotiate its way around instead.  Charlie was disappointed, he wanted the ant to go over the mound.  He almost reached out to pinch the blanket up, extend the ridge and force the ant to go over, but decided against it.  The decision wasn’t his in the end.  The ant had to pick its own path.

  It’s like I’m talking to a wall, said Charlie’s father, Jesus honey it’s like I’m talking to a fucking wall.

  Charlie’s mother choked politely on her pastrami.  Dear! Language! she said.

  He’s almost six years old for crying out loud.  I knew what a fucking wall was when I was six.  I also knew how to listen to my father.

  Charlie’s father was filling out the space now, stretching his shadow across the picnic blanket, blocking out the light that filtered in between the leaves.  He was finding that he could build his own walls out here, out on this sunny hill above the ocean.  Even on top of this bright, airy expanse, Charlie’s father could make the world feel as small as he wanted.

  In Charlie’s left leg the tingling was blossoming into a pulsing ache.  The ant was getting so close now, less than a hand’s breadth away from the sticky prize.  Moving now would be an unforgiveable sin.

  He’s still a child, dear said Charlie’s mother, If he doesn’t want to eat then he doesn’t have to eat.

  He has to listen, though.

  Charlie’s father smacked his fist into his palm, hard.  The noise, the motion, the sudden violence caught Charlie by surprise.  He looked up, startled, into the eyes of his father.  Charlie realized he hadn’t blinked in minutes, his eyes were watering.  He rubbed them with the back of his hand and then, as an afterthought, wiped his nose too.  A thin layer of snot came away to rest lightly on the skin above his wrist.

  His mother shrilled, Charlie I have told you twice now, I am not going to tell you again!  Why won’t you just blow your nose?

  This is exactly what I’m talking about, said Charlie’s father, pointing a finger at his son, this is what happens when you teach a child not to listen.

  Charlie blinked a few times, looked back and forth between his mother and his father.  They towered on either side of him.  The light that had filtered down through the trees was blotted out.  The wind that had stirred the thin, pale hairs on his arm was quieted.  A dim, thick presence hung in the air, stagnating motion, muffling the colors.  The air grew moist and hot.  It drummed upon Charlie’s temples, a rhythmic beat.  His leg was finished pulsing, it was throbbing now, screaming for release.

  The ant.  Charlie looked back down.  The ant had reached the jar of jam and was now scaling the smooth glass.  It climbed this final distance with ease, inches away from its destination.

  What are you looking at, boy? said Charlie’s father.  He traced the gaze of his son down to the jar.

  Oh, he said, we’ve got ants.

  He reared up from his place of rest against the tree and leaned one knee down across the blanket.  Charlie imagined this moment from the ant’s perspective.  To the ant the sound of Charlie’s father’s knee falling onto the blanket must have been a massive, godly thump, the shake of a massive earthquake  The ant was less than an inch away from the end now, but paused to ride out the shaking of the blanket.  Charlie’s father reached out his hand and deftly crushed the ant between his thumb and forefinger.

  Somewhere, in another part of the world, at this exact moment, a glass shattered upon a tile floor.  The sound that this accident made is exactly the same as the one that Charlie heard in his own mind.

  The first time that Charlie had tried to drink from a real glass, he dropped it.  He remembered the moment well, how his father had taken away the plastic bottle despite his mother’s protests, poured the milk into a tall glass and handed it to him.  He remembered how the smooth glass had slipped out of his hands immediately, shattering on the tile floor.  That is the noise that Charlie heard in the back of his mind as his father crushed the ant between his meaty fingers.  The sound of a glass smashing to pieces on a tile floor.

  There was a bluff, less than thirty feet away from their picnic, that overlooked the ocean.  Charlie gathered up a half of the peanut-butter jelly sandwich in each hand and started running towards it.  His mother was slow to react.  She was barely on her feet by the time he reached the edge and hurled the sandwich towards the sea with both hands.  Charlie watched the sandwich fall through tear-filled eyes.  It held its shape as it fell, two distinct halves, smacking into the water below and then sinking out of sight.  He wiped at the mess of tears and snot pouring down his face with hands that were already covered in the sticky guts of his sandwich.  His leg felt wonderful, the blood pumped through it joyfully, filling his muscles with warmth.

  A second later Charlie’s mother’s arm was around his chest and lifting him up.  She burned angry words into his ear as she carried him back to the tree.

  Don’t you ever run away from me like that again!  You almost gave me a heart-attack, do you know that?

  Charlie’s father hadn’t moved from under the tree.  Well, he said, at least he finally did something.

  The wind picked up again, gentle gusts.  In front of the depression where Charlie had been sitting, an unused wad of tissues began to move.  It unfurled itself, flipped once onto its back and was borne away.  It floated for a while, dipping between the heavens and the earth.  Patiently, with slow, swinging steps the tissues drifted away from the hill, out past the bluff and over the ocean.")

Story.create(title: "Small Pieces of Machinery", path: "machinery.docx", body: "Prior Moore’s apartment is two stories.  The walls are mostly white, except for the kitchen.  In the kitchen, the walls are patterned with fat little cherubs staring wistfully at the ass of the next fat little cherub.  There was a decorator at some point, someone with a lot of energy and opinions about negative space.  They tried to engage with Prior in a discussion about what kind of furniture should be purchased, and how it should be arranged.  Prior had very little input on this process, the end result of which was a smattering of menacing chairs that were most likely rejected from Guantanamo Bay for being too uncomfortable.  Two days after the decorator left, Prior ordered a Laz-E-Boy on the internet.

  Prior’s apartment gazes majestically over the pristine waters of Chicago’s Lake Michigan.  It gazes rather less interestedly at a park, as well as a highway, both of which antecede the aforementioned pristine waters.  As Prior lives on the twelfth (and, technically, the thirteenth) floor of his fifteen story building, he is offered an excellent view of whichever side of the highway is currently being the most interesting.  On a typical day, the most interesting side of the highway is neither of them.

  Every morning at seven thirty a.m. Prior goes to work in an office filled with people who are about as friendly as his Guantanamo Bay chairs.  Prior spends a small amount of time in this place moving his fingers in meaningful patterns across a keyboard.  He spends much of the remainder of his time watching his co-workers do distasteful things when they think nobody’s looking.  Cubicles allow these people to achieve almost domestic levels of comfort. Inevitably during the long, tedious day they will forget that they might be under observation, much like someone on a long drive might begin to pick their nose only to look over and find that they are being judged by a Protestant family of honor role students.

  Prior’s favorite co-worker to watch is Deborah a plump and unpleasant woman who works three cubicles down across the aisle.  Deborah has a variety of strange habits that Prior finds simultaneously disturbing and fascinating.  The most interesting of these is that she clips her fingernails at work with a small pair of pink scissors, and then shuffles the clippings into a drawer on her desk.  The first time Prior noticed it he assumed he was going crazy.  After all, there was a trash can right next to the drawer where she was apparently saving her discarded cuticles.  To be entirely certain of his observation, he waited in the office late one night until almost everyone had left, and then went over to her desk and checked the drawer.  Inside was a small mountain of nail clippings.

Prior didn’t know what to make of this, but he does have several theories, all of which are wrong and reflect poorly on his judgment.  The real reason that Deborah keeps her nails is simple; she is a hoarder.  She has one of those incredible houses that are filled with towering piles of junk and childhood memorabilia.  Three weeks from now the structural integrity of one of these piles will fail, and Deborah will die after being struck in the temple by a thousand-piece blue-sky puzzle box that she filled with her childhood rock collection.  With better deductive reasoning and a more altruistic attitude, Prior might have been able to affect this outcome.

  When Prior leaves work, the hardest part of his day begins.  Though he is not an unfit, unintelligent or unattractive man, he has always been inept at social interaction.  While those around him pair off or group up to go somewhere and laugh at each other, Prior goes directly home and remains there for the rest of his night.  At his work Prior can accept solitude, but at home he feels a pressure that builds against his introversion.  Prior knows that unnamed forces expect him to be out laughing at people as well, and judge him for his failure to comply.

  The result of this pressure is nothing.  That’s a lie.  The result of this pressure is that Prior achieves this nothing with a perpetual sense of discomfort that make his solitary activities far less enjoyable.  Sometimes he will watch television, sometimes he will read.  Sometimes he will look out of his majestic window at his majestic view.

  A couple months ago, when it was colder, Prior watched homeless people in the park below his window as they gathered around fires.  He even bought binoculars so that he could better observe their clustered, communicating shapes.  They had so much to say to each other.  Prior found it fascinating that they would have so much to say to each other.  He was just beginning to pick up lip reading when the cops evicted them.  After that, bum-resistant barbed wire was installed around the park fence.  Prior’s landlady sent out an email announcing her victory over the temporarily-warm individuals that ended with a winky-face emoticon.  ;-).

  If Prior’s world was a metaphor, then it would be a music box that played one tune at one pace and was operated by an aging Swedish man named Sven who was very particular about perfect meter and adept at the maintenance of small pieces of machinery.  The tedium of Prior’s routine was paralleled only by the staggering expectation of more tedium.  Having only lived the one life and therefore lacking a certain amount of perspective, Prior was unaware of the monumental levels of boredom he was achieving.  Contentment poorly sums up the utter acceptance that Prior felt towards his music box, because contentment has some awareness that there are other possibilities.

  If Prior was possessed of a broader consciousness, he would wonder if his life was ever going to change.  To his great surprise, the answer would actually be yes.

  Here is the impetus that will begin this change.  Deep beneath the surface of the earth, two tectonic plates are going to hit an unusually disagreeable rough patch.  This is not an accident.  Tectonic plates have been watching Prior for a long time, and, losing patience, have decided to intervene.  The collision will send reverberations through many layers of magma and molten rock until they reach the surface of the earth.  By San Andreas’ standards the collision will register as little more than a geological burp, and almost nobody in the world will ever know that the disagreement occurred.  All that will happen is that one square of sidewalk, specifically the square at the bottom of the steps to Prior’s building will sink exactly 1.23 inches into the earth and then settle there.  Waiting.

2.

  The alarm clock that sits next to Prior’s bed goes off the next morning at seven a.m. exactly.  It does not play any music, nor repeat a funny pre-recorded mantra.  It makes the sound of defcon five, over and over, a sound that a synesthetic girl once told Prior is definitely the color of vomit.  Prior spends the next three minutes thinking about not getting out of bed.  This is the first of his many morning rituals.  He thinks about calling his boss, telling him that’s he’s sick.  He has the whole speech planned out.  In Prior’s mind, this is how the speech would go.

  Hello?  Mr. Watterschmidt?

  Speaking.

  It’s me sir, it’s Prior.  Prior Moore.

  A short pause here while Prior would await some kind of recognition from his boss.

  Mr. Watterschmidt would break the silence.  Well?

  I don’t think I can come in to work today sir.

  What did you say?  Speak up Moore, you’re mumbling.

  I said I don’t think I can come in to work today.

  Oh?  Why is that?

  Well you see sir, I’m not feeling that well.

  Not feeling that well?

  Yes sir.

  Is that it?

  Well, yes but I –

  Moore, today is a pretty busy day for us, a lot of new clients coming in.  I think you’re going to have to come in anyways.

  Oh well I don’t know if that’s a good idea, sir, I might… well I could get other people sick.

  You just let someone with management experience worry about that, Moore.

  Then Mr. Watterschmidt would hang up the phone, and Prior would sit in silence for a while thinking about how he now has to spend his whole day at work pretending to cough every time his boss comes around.  This is how Prior imagines things would go.  They would probably go worse.

  Three minutes later, Prior gets up.

  He throws white comforters over white sheets and slides his feet into pink bunny slippers from the Pottery Barn.  These slippers cost 24.99, and boast a micro-fiber lining with ComforTread Technology©.  You can find them at potterybarn.com, where they are currently not on sale.  Prior marches his bunnies to his bathroom, which has a heated tile floor.  When Prior bought the bunnies, he hadn’t considered the compounding effect of a heated floor and Pottery Barn’s one-of-a-kind ComforTread Technology©.  That effect is sweaty feet.  He would take the slippers off, but he is possessed by the certainty that morning people wear slippers, and therefore he must as well.

  After he is finished in the bathroom, Prior marches to the kitchen in his soggy slippers and has a bowl of Cheerios, half a grapefruit and a glass of orange juice.  Some days he will have to cut into a new grapefruit, and some days he will have a half ready for him, sitting under Saran Wrap.  In a very small way, Prior savors the day when he doesn’t have to cut into a new grapefruit.  This is because Prior, like almost everyone else in the world, is a bit lazy.

  As Prior eats his breakfast, his well-advertised window treats him to a well-advertised sunrise, the kind of sunrise that would be perfect on a postcard with the word ‘Chicago!’ under it.  Unfortunately for him, the angle of the sun bounces off his incredibly shiny kitchen table, so that if Prior lets his head rest down enough the light will hit him in the eyes.  To avoid being blinded by his shiny furniture, Prior eats his breakfast every morning with exceptional posture.

  Eventually, the Cheerios are gone.  Prior frees his feet from the bunny slippers now, and lets them rest in the cool carpet of his bedroom.  They enjoy this freedom for about five minutes while Prior puts his suit on.  It is a gray suit, with pinstripes, that he got with his mother when he graduated college.  Pinstripes are good. she said to him as they both sized him up in the mirror.  Behind them, the sizing lady chewed bubblegum.  Her name was Wanda, and she was forty-five year old Korean-American.  Right then, she was thinking about the dress in aisle seven, the red one with the black sash.  The dress cost 549.99 after the employee discount, which wasn’t as much as you would expect.  Wanda was planning on stealing that dress.  Wanda would carry out her plan later that day, which involved waiting until no one was looking, clipping the security tag and making a run for it.  She would be unsuccessful.  Prior’s mother continued, Pinstripes are the most serious of the stripes.

  Five minutes would pass, and Prior’s feet would be subjected to their second torture of the day, which was an impressively uncomfortable pair of dress shoes.  These shoes were made with hard angles, and had very little give.  Wanda said they were Italian.  They were actually made in Vietnam by a boy named Danh.  Prior takes the discomfort caused by the dress shoes for granted.  Their clog-like rigidity seems appropriate to him.

  Now that Prior is cleaned, fed, and dressed, he leaves his apartment.   The hallway is green, and lit by seashell wall lamps that give off a gentle glow.  Prior finds that if he spends too long there, he becomes very sleepy.  He has a daydream turned paranoid theory that the landlady uses these sleepy hallways to lull unsuspecting residents to sleep, at which point she kidnaps them and sends them off to be fry-cooks at a chain of greasy southern-style restaurants in Albuquerque.  For this reason, Prior has allowed himself to fall asleep twice in the hall outside his room.  Twice now Frank, the building super, has found Prior sleeping in the hall and left him there.  Frank has found several residents in this position over the last eight years, and while he doesn’t understand it, he feels it is not his place to judge.

  Prior used to get on the elevator at 7:31 in the morning.  He found that if he gets on at this time, he almost always has people get on the elevator and go down with him.  Prior hates it when other people are on the elevator.  He hates that on an elevator, you have to actively pretend not to notice someone.  They are one of the few spaces in the world where this is socially acceptable.  After a few months of unbearable, silent, forward-staring elevator rides, Prior moved his routine back five minutes and started getting in at 7:26.  For whatever reason, this time is characterized by a depressed rate of elevator-goers, and now Prior almost never has to share.

  Today Prior is getting in at 7:25.  He shaved a minute off at some point, he doesn’t know where.  He thinks that it was probably his socks.  He must have put on his socks really quickly today.  Prior makes it to the fifth floor before the elevator stops.  Prior groans inwardly, moves to his left and fixes his gaze stoically upon the faux-wooden paneling in front of him.  A young woman gets in, moves to the back right corner, and resumes staring at the tiny screen she keeps with her at all times so that she won’t have to look at anything else.  This works for Prior.  The tiny screen is an excuse to not feel quite as ignored in the elevator as usual.

  Prior looks over at the woman for a second to see if she is attractive or not.  She is.  At least she has a nice body, and she’s wearing white shorts that barely cover her ass.  He can’t see her face since it is turned down into her portable distraction device. The woman seems so invested, in fact, that Prior wonders if he could set off fireworks on his side of the elevator without her noticing.  This gives him enough confidence to try and get a look at her face.  He glances over, and finds her staring back at him.  She has a gloating look on her face, which is in fact rather pretty.  Prior looks back at the paneling quickly, busies himself in an eye-level whorl in the faux wood that he’s seen a hundred times before.  The elevator chimes for the third floor, then the second, then finally stops.

  As Prior moves to get off the elevator, the young woman pushes past him, asserting her dominance. Prior follows behind her.  The woman pushes through the double doors of their building and descends the steps.  Prior is watching her ass descend the steps when he notices the lip in the sidewalk.  The woman still has her phone out, she certainly doesn’t see the depression in the concrete.  Prior realizes he should say something.  He bumps through the double doors clumsily, opens his mouth.  She hits the bottom step, and suddenly the ground is not where she expects it to be.

3.

  She falls spectacularly.  Many actors have spent many thousands of hours trying to simulate a perfect flop.  Not one of them came close to the total commitment that the young woman displays.  She is a toddler at a swimming pool.  She is a narcoleptic sprinter on a bad day.  She falls with a level of grace that can only be achieved by someone who has absolutely no idea they are falling.  When we fall, or when something equally unexpected happens, we instinctively protect whatever is most important to us at the moment.  This is an evolutionary impulse, coded into our DNA, so that in moments of sudden crisis parents will protect their young and their young will protect themselves.  Perhaps this is why, as the young woman falls, she raises her phone high over her head.  Unfortunately for her, this is not what the government would describe as an ideal crash safety position.  You can’t blame somebody for their instincts.

  The young woman’s body connects with the pavement chin first.  The cell phone, high up in its precarious perch would have been fine were it not for the concussion that she sustained when her chin hit the concrete.  No evolutionary impulses can stop fingers from loosening upon moderate brain trauma.  Thanks to the young woman’s efforts, the phone falls no more than ten inches before landing screen first on the concrete.  The manufacturer of this phone, however, expected this situation, and designed the phone to be ludicrously fragile so that people would constantly break them and have to get new ones.  The screen shatters in three different places.  Her left arm is badly fractured.  Her warranty is expired.  Retail is 479.99.  She bit through her tongue.

  Prior, meanwhile is standing at the top of the stairs, frozen.  His mouth is still hanging open, and will stay that way for the next two-and-a-half seconds. This is long enough for a little bit of drool to come out of his mouth, which is entirely inappropriate for the situation.  After almost three seconds go by Prior finally has a thought, the first of three in quick succession.  First, someone should call the cops.  Then, someone should help her.  Finally, I am the only one here.  I have to do these things.  He hurries down to her side and says the three stupidest words than anyone can say in an emergency.

  Are you ok?

  She looks back up him slowly with pupils the size of quarters, and blood begins to spout from her chin.

  Prior decides that she is in fact, probably not ok.  He pulls out his phone and dials 9-1-1.

  9-1-1 what is your emergency?

  Hi!  Hello!  Um, this woman, she fell, she’s bleeding, like from her face, she looks really messed up.  I asked her if she was ok, and she didn’t say anything.

  Ok sir where are you right now?

  At that exact moment, Prior’s address decides to take a quick leave of absence from his brain.  It simply gets up, packs a bag, and fucks off to the coast for a little R and R.

  I- uh- hold on, just a second.

  Prior looks down at the young woman, who thankfully will remember none of this.

  What’s our address?

  She doesn’t register this comment.  She is looking a foot ahead of her at her shattered phone while a small pool of blood forms under her head.

  The operator cuts back in, Sir?

  Um, ok, we’re at the Gates building, the Gates Apartment building.  On Lakeview Drive.

  The address comes back, with a tan, and a necklace with a shark-tooth on the end of it.

  OH MY GOD ok 1127 Forest Hills Drive.  That’s my address.  Sorry.  Sorry about that.

  Silence for a second from the operator, then, We have an ambulance on the way.  Now I need you to stay with her for the next few minutes, do you understand?

  Prior begins to feel a strange tightening in his chest, the kind that you get if you jump into a lake in December or forget your lines in a school play.  He realizes that he is having an anxiety attack.  The realization that he is having an anxiety attack at such a crucial moment makes him even more anxious, and Prior begins to sweat profusely.

  The 9-1-1 operator chimes back in, Sir?

  Prior begins patting around his pockets looking for his anti-anxiety medication before remembering that he keeps it in his medicine cabinet.  For whatever reason his brain takes this moment to contemplate the absurdity of that decision.  What kind of person has an anxiety attack in the bathroom?  What sort of situation would both induce the need for anti-anxiety medication, and also afford the anxious party time to go to their bathroom and return?  Prior makes a mental note to keep his damn meds on him from now on.

  It has been over twenty seconds now since Prior has responded to the operator.  She is becoming very concerned.  She prompts him again, Sir please respond if you are still there.

  Prior jolts back to the present, Sorry!  Sorry yes I’m still here.
  Is she bleeding?

  Prior looks down at the girl.  Her chin is starting to bleed less, going from a healthy spurt to a clotted burble.  Her hair has fallen into the puddle on the ground, just at the tips.  Prior notices for the first time that she has short blond hair, attractive hair.  It bothers him that she can’t keep her hair out of the blood.

  Yes, from her chin.  It’s not so bad, like it was bleeding a lot before, but now not so much, I don’t think it’s like dangerous bleeding.  Just bleeding.

  The tightening in Prior’s chest is now making it hard for him to breathe.  He also is feeling a sudden urge to urinate.  So this anxiety attack is now decidedly more ‘forget your lines at the school play’ than ‘lake in December’.

  Um, operator? says Prior, I think I’m having a little bit of a panic attack over here.  I’m kind of an anxious guy, you know.  Anyways I have these meds but they’re upstairs and uh, well.  Would it be alright if I just ran upstairs really quickly?

  What? No! No sorry you absolutely cannot just run upstairs really quickly.  You need to stay with her so that we can monitor her condition while the ambulance is on its way.

  Prior continues, Yeah, yeah I get that but it will just take a minute and I’m really not feeling good.  My therapist, Dr. Green says I don’t handle stressful situations very well on my own and-

  The operator cuts Prior off, Ok sir I understand that these situations are stressful but I need you to stay with her.  The ambulance will be there shortly.  Can you take a deep breath for me?

Prior closes his eyes puts the palm of his hand to his forehead and takes a deep breath.  The tightness in his chest eases slightly.
  The operator waits.

  Ok, Prior says, I’m ok.  Wow, sorry, I’m really sorry about that.

  It’s perfectly normal.  Can you tell me your name?

  Prior.  It’s Prior.

  Thank you Prior.  Now Prior, can you describe her other injuries?

  Yes.  Um, I think she has a concussion.  Like her eyes are huge, and she isn’t really making words, so… Oh and her arm, her arm does not look good.  Purple and lumpy.  It looks broken.

  Ok Prior I need you to do your best to keep her still and talking until the ambulance arrives.  Can you do that?

  Yeah, yeah I can do that.

  Ok.  I’ll be on the line with you the whole time.

  Prior has been pacing in small circles for the last minute.  He settles himself, then turns back to the woman.  She’s looking up at him now, still not saying anything.  Her brow is creased, slightly, and though her eyes are still dilated beyond recognition, the bewildered look on her face is unmistakable.  Prior tries to imagine what this woman could possibly be thinking.  Where am I?  What happened?  Who the hell are you?  Prior decides to take the initiative and answer these questions. He sits down next to her, locks eyes on her massive pupils.

  My name is Prior.  You had an accident.  You fell.  On your face.  And also your arm.

  The look of confusion stays.  Aside from the slightly ragged rise and fall of her breath, she is completely still.

  The ambulance is on its way.

  Still, the woman remains inert.  Prior changes tactics.

  Can you tell me your name?

  Still nothing.  At least she isn’t moving, Prior thinks to himself.  That’s half my job.  The operator pipes up again.

  Has her condition changed at all?

  No, she’s good.  I mean the same.  She’s not good.  But not worse.

  Sirens wail from around the corner, and then careen wildly onto Lakeview Drive.

  Prior breathes a sigh of relief.  Oh thank god.

  Next to him on the ground, the young woman says something that Prior can’t hear.

  He turns to her, What?

  Her expression hasn’t changed one bit.  She looks at him with her crazy eyes, coughs a little, and says, Briar.

  Then the ambulance pulls up.  There is a flurry of activity as people trained to handle situations such as these tend to the woman, shine a light in her eyes, gently remove Prior from the area.  It all happens very quickly, one minute she was looking at him and the next she is loaded up into the back of the ambulance and the doors are closing behind her and she is wearing one of those little neck things and then they are driving her away.  Prior finds himself alone on the sidewalk next to a small puddle of blood.  He wonders who is going to clean it up.")
